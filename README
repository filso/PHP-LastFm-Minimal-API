This is PHP Last.FM minimal api access library. Implemented are authentication
flow, basic data fetching mechanism, and error handling.

Library is meant to be simple, leaving all abstraction for programmer,
and being as transparent, as possible.

example.php shows, how to use it.

I'm sorry for my fluent english, I'm ashamed. ;D
